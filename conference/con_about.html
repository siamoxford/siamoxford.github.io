          <p class="mb-3"> The 11<sup>th</sup> annual Oxford SIAM-IMA Student Conference will be hosted on Wednesday 8 May 2019 in the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. <br><br>

          The aim of the conference is to bring together undergraduate and graduate students, young researchers, and faculty from a wide range of disciplines sharing a common interest in industrial and applied mathematics. Participants will have the opportunity to interact with one another, share their research/study interests, and make useful contacts from the academic community and industry.  <br><br>

          You will need to register to be a participant. Participation is completely free and includes free lunch as well as free pizza and refreshments following the conference. <br><br>

          We encourage any students attending the conference to submit an abstract for a talk or poster.
