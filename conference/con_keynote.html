          <p class="mb-3"> Camille Duprat is an Assistant Professor at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. Her research is concerned with solid mechanics and fluid dynamics, with a focus on low Reynolds number fluid motions; those dominated by viscosity. Camille utilises both theoretical and experimental studies, and at the moment, is looking at problems involving the coupling of capillary-driven and elastic structures.

          <h5 class="mt-4 text-danger">Catching drops with fibers</h5>
          <p class="mb-3"><span class="oi oi-clock"></span> &nbsp; 0940-1030<br></p>
          <p> The passive filtration of liquid droplets from aerosol streams or emulsions is done by placing a porous (generally fibrous) structure in the path of the mist; in particular, woven nets are used to harvest fresh water from fog, and non-woven entangled fibers are used to filter oil drops from gas streams. In this talk, I will present recent results on the capture of aerosol droplets with an array of parallel fibers. We identify the key role played by the drop distribution on the fibers on the overall collection efficiency. Due to a growth and coalescence process, this drop distribution evolves toward a regular pattern of uniformly distributed drops, and a balance between capillarity and gravity sets an average drop size. Accounting for these effects in a simple inertial impaction model allows a quantitative prediction of the collection efficiency.  As the droplets accumulate on the fibers, they might merge and bridge adjacent fibers. If the fibers are flexible, they may deform under the capillary forces generated by these liquide bridges. In particular, we report and characterize a regime of strong elasto-capillary adhesion where the fibers are collapsed and form long liquid columns, efficiently capturing the incoming droplets.

          <p class="mb-3"> Dr. Bangti Jin received Ph.D. degree in applied mathematics from the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, in 2008. Previously, he was an assistant Professor of mathematics at University of California, Riverside (2013-2014), a visiting assistant professor at Texas A&M University (2010-2013), an Alexandre von Humboldt Postdoctoral Researcher at the University of Bremen (2009-2010). He is currently a Reader in inverse problems in the Department of Computer Science, University College London, London, U.K. His research interests include computational inverse problems and numerical analysis of differential equations.  </p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 text-danger">Stochastic gradient descent for inverse problems</h5>
          <p class="mb-3"><span class="oi oi-clock"></span> &nbsp; 1630-1720<br></p>
          <p> In this talk, I will discuss the stochastic gradient descent (including randomized Kaczmarz method) for solving inverse problems. Such algorithms have been very popular in practice, especially in computed tomography, and recently in machine learning. However, their theory for ill-posed inverse problems remains largely missing. In this talk, I will present some recent results in inverse problems, and some relevant results in machine learning.
