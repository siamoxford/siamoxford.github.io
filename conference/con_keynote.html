          <p class="mb-3"> Camille Duprat is an Assistant Professor at Ecole Polytechnique in Paris. Her research is concerned with solid mechanics and fluid dynamics, with a focus on low Reynolds number fluid motions; those dominated by viscosity. Camille utilises both theoretical and experimental studies, and at the moment, is looking at problems involving the coupling of capillary-driven and elastic structures.

          <h5 class="mt-4 text-danger">Catching drops with fibers</h5>
          <p class="mb-3"><span class="oi oi-clock"></span> &nbsp; TBC<br></p>
          <p> The passive filtration of liquid droplets from aerosol streams or emulsions is done by placing a porous (generally fibrous) structure in the path of the mist; in particular, woven nets are used to harvest fresh water from fog, and non-woven entangled fibers are used to filter oil drops from gas streams. In this talk, I will present recent results on the capture of aerosol droplets with an array of parallel fibers. We identify the key role played by the drop distribution on the fibers on the overall collection efficiency. Due to a growth and coalescence process, this drop distribution evolves toward a regular pattern of uniformly distributed drops, and a balance between capillarity and gravity sets an average drop size. Accounting for these effects in a simple inertial impaction model allows a quantitative prediction of the collection efficiency.  As the droplets accumulate on the fibers, they might merge and bridge adjacent fibers. If the fibers are flexible, they may deform under the capillary forces generated by these liquide bridges. In particular, we report and characterize a regime of strong elasto-capillary adhesion where the fibers are collapsed and form long liquid columns, efficiently capturing the incoming droplets.

          <p class="mb-2">Lecturer, Center for Automotive Engineering,
Department of Mechanical Engineering Sciences<br></p>
          <p class="mb-3"><span class="oi oi-map"></span> &nbsp; University of Surrey<br></p>
          <p class="mb-3"> Dr Teng Zhang is a lecturer in Automotive Engineering in the department of Mechanical Engineering Sciences. He obtained his PhD from National University of Singapore in 2014 on multi-scale modelling of organic solar cells. Before joining University of Surrey, he spent 3 years as a research associate at Imperial College London working on modelling and testing of high energy-density lithium-sulfur batteries for automotive applications. He contributed to several UK and EU projects in collaboration with industry, such as the 'REVB (Revolutionary Electric Vehicle Batteries)' and the 'ECLIPSE (Next-generation Battery Technology for Space Applications )' projects on lithium-sulfur batteries, and the 'ALICE (Advanced Lithium-Ion Capacitor Electrodes )' project on lithium-ion capacitors.</p>

          <h5 class="mt-4 text-danger">Mathematical modelling of lithium-sulfur batteries</h5>
          <p class="mb-3"><span class="oi oi-clock"></span> &nbsp; TBC<br></p>
          <p> The market demand for electric vehicles with longer driving ranges has heightened the need for high-energy-density batteries. Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries could bring a step-change in the performance of automotive batteries with their 2-3 times higher energy density than today’s lithium-ion batteries. While already commercially viable in niche applications, wider market uptake of Li-S technology is currently hindered by a lack of understanding of their unique operational behaviours governed by complex the Li-S chemistry.

          In this talk, I will give a brief overview of the requirements and challenges of modelling Li-S batteries for informing battery design and control. Following the Occam's razor principle, a relatively simple Li-S model is derived that captures only those mechanisms that are required to reproduce the observable charge/discharge characteristics of Li-S batteries. I will show how such a model have delivered essential knowledge for commercially-sized lithium-sulphur batteries, such as identifying the probable main causes of discharge rate limits [1], charge rate limits [2], and decoupling their memory effect from irreversible degradation [3], despite being the most mathematically and computationally simple Li-S model in the literature. The potential application of the model for real-time Li-S battery control and management will be discussed.

          <h5 class="mt-4 text-danger">Stochastic gradient descent for inverse problems</h5>
          <p class="mb-3"><span class="oi oi-clock"></span> &nbsp; TBC<br></p>
          <p> In this talk, I will discuss the stochastic gradient descent (including randomized Kaczmarz method) for solving inverse problems. Such algorithms have been very popular in practice, especially in computed tomography, and recently in machine learning. However, their theory for ill-posed inverse problems remains largely missing. In this talk, I will present some recent results in inverse problems, and some relevant results in machine learning.
